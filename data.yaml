abstract: |
  <p>We propose a novel complete algorithm for multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) called <span class="text-danger">lazy constraints addition search for MAPF (LaCAM)</span>.
  MAPF is a problem of finding collision-free paths for multiple agents on graphs and is the foundation of multi-robot coordination.
  LaCAM uses a two-level search to find solutions quickly, even with hundreds of agents or more.
  At the low-level, it searches constraints about agents' locations.
  At the high-level, it searches a sequence of all agents' locations, following the constraints specified by the low-level.
  Our exhaustive experiments reveal that LaCAM is comparable to or outperforms state-of-the-art sub-optimal MAPF algorithms in a variety of scenarios, regarding success rate, planning time, and solution quality of sum-of-costs.</p>
